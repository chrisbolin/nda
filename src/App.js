        <h2>II. Unilateral Agreement</h2>
        <p>The Receiving Party expressly acknowledges and affirms their consent to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Henceforth, this Agreement can be referred to as a "Non-Disclosure Agreement" or "NDA." The primary objective of this Agreement is to enable the Receiving Party to claim truthfully that they have "signed an NDA" concerning the information as described in Section III below. This Agreement shall commence its effect on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for ten (10) years henceforth.</p>

        <h2>III. Confidential Information</h2>
        <p>The Receiving Party hereby acknowledges and confirms that this Agreement is specifically intended to govern the handling, use, and disclosure of certain sensitive information, collectively referred to as the "Confidential Information." The Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business plans, financial data, know-how, wasted summers, embarrassing jobs, misspent time, awkward photos, failed relationships, and any other non-public information which is known or has been known by the Receiving Party. This Agreement specifically includes, but is not limited to, {printedReason}.</p>

        <h2 className="page-break-before">IV. Stipulations</h2>

          <li>
            <h3>No Further Benefits</h3>
            <p>The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that beyond the obligations and benefits expressly outlined in this Agreement, no other benefits, rights, or entitlements shall arise from this Agreement. In its speculation and naivety, this Agreement is best thought of as fan fiction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Legal Advice</h3>
            <p>The Receiving Party further acknowledges that this Agreement has been prepared without the involvement of any legal counsel whatsoever.

            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or contrary to law, the invalid provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement, and any remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
